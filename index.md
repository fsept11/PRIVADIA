## Project

The widespread use of devices with internet access, together with the increasing availability of cloud computing platforms and recent advances in AI, has given rise to a multitude of Machine Learning as a Service applications. With their increasing popularity has also come increasing awareness that they also potentially compromise users' privacy, as shown by the intense public debate that led to, and followed, the creation of GDPR (EU’s General Data Protection Regulation). Among other data types, speech stands out by the amount of information that may be extracted from it which goes far beyond the linguistic contents. In fact, one can extract information regarding demographic traits such as gender, age range, accent, level of education, physical characteristics such as height, emotional status, personality traits, levels of stress, intoxication, sleepiness, etc. Moreover, speech can be used as a biomarker for many diseases that affect speech. This implies that one should regard speech as “Personally Identifiable Information”. Privacy-preserving machine learning for speech is thus the overarching topic of the PRIVADIA project.

Among many other tasks, current machine learning models are able to automatically transcribe speech recordings, identify speakers, and perform "diarization", often referred to as the problem of determining “who spoke when” in a conversation. Privacy in diarization is the particular focus of the current project, as illustrative of a very complex processing chain, related with speaker characteristics. This project addresses this topic by combining state-of-the-art diarization methods (typically based on speaker embeddings obtained from the hidden layers of deep neural networks) with cryptographic techniques.

Other speech processing tasks may also be contemplated, namely in order to explore privacy-oriented speech manipulation approaches that avoid the computational burden of cryptographic paradigms.
